## REST Endpoints

Base path: /api

Health:
- GET /api/health/

Conversations:
- POST /api/conversations/start/
  body: { patient_id, metadata? }
- POST /api/conversations/send/
  body: { conversation_id, sender: "patient"|"bot", text, patient_id? }
  notes:
    - If conversation_id exists, the message is appended.
    - If conversation_id does not exist and patient_id is provided, a new conversation is created for that patient and the message is appended. Response status 201.
    - If conversation_id does not exist and patient_id is not provided, 404 is returned with a helpful hint.
- POST /api/conversations/continue/
  body: { conversation_id, messages: [{sender, text}, ...] }
- GET /api/conversations/status/?conversation_id=<uuid>

Notes:
- POST /api/notes/generate/
  body: { conversation_id, note_title? }
  returns: { conversation_id, note_title, note_text }

Local Save:
- POST /api/notes/save-local/
  body: { conversation_id, note_text, filename }
  behavior: Saves .txt file to ONEDRIVE_SAVE_DIR (configurable) or fallback C:\Nilesh_TATA\Prescription. API returns success/failure details.

AI:
- POST /api/ai/next-follow-up/
  body: { conversation_id }
  returns: { conversation_id, question }

- POST /api/ai/generate-and-save-summary/
  body: { conversation_id, filename, note_title? }
  behavior: Generates an AI summary and saves it as .txt to ONEDRIVE_SAVE_DIR.

## Local Save Directory

- Files are written to: C:\Nilesh_TATA\Prescription
- The application ensures the directory exists (creates it if missing).
- Filenames will enforce a .txt extension if not provided.
- On write failure (permissions, disk, path issues), the API returns an error with details.

## Notes

- Authentication is set to AllowAny as a placeholder. Integrate with your preferred auth method in production.
- The note generation is rule-based for clarity; you can replace it with an LLM-backed summarizer.
- Error responses follow a consistent Ocean Professional payload.
